# Monorepo Template

This is a **monorepo template** using `pnpm` as the package manager and `turbo` for task running and pipeline management. The setup includes configurations for multiple playground environments and a set of common development tools.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** >= 20
- **pnpm** >= 9.7.0

## Setup

Before running any scripts, ensure that `pnpm` is the only allowed package manager:

```bash
pnpm install
